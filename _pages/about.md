I have become a master's supervisor and have started mentoring master students now. 
I am working at the Artificial Intelligence & Bio-information Cognition (AIBC) Group of Jiangxi Science and Technology Normal University.
I received my B.E. degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Jiangxi Science and Technology Normal University in 2012, and the M.S. degree, which is advised by Prof. Zhijian Yan and co-advised by [Prof. Feiniu Yuan](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yfn/), in signal and information processing with the School of Communications and Electronics, Jiangxi Science and Technology Normal University, Nanchang, China, in 2018. In 2022, I obtained the Ph.D. degree, which is advised by [Prof. Yuming Fang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Tu-eHkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) , from Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, Nanchang, China. 
  
My research interest includes visual understanding, image captioning, and pattern recognition. I have published 10 papers at international AI conferences and journals with total<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xXDl1kgAAAAJ&hl'> Google Scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>300+</span></strong></a> (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xXDl1kgAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
